# Cohorty

## Description

Cohorty is a modern web application designed to facilitate the tracking of courses, students, and assignments for General Assembly. This app streamlines administrative tasks, enhances staff and administrator visibility, and provides a centralized platform for managing academic data. By centralizing these processes, we aim to improve the efficiency of administrative operations and provide staff with a user-friendly interface to track student progress.
